2. In the search field type "FooGallery Owl Carousel"
3. Click install
4. Click Activate

###It's Installed. What do I do now?
Assuming you already have [FooGallery](http://wordpress.org/plugins/foogallery) installed, go to "FooGallery > Extensions". Then go to the "Build Your Own" tab and you'll see the Owl Carousel there.
